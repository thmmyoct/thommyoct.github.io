                                <h2>Interesting Facts About The Shawshank Redemption</h2>
                                <p>If you have never seen or are not even interested in watching the Shawshank Redemption movie, iKNOWLEDGE will share several reasons why you should watch the film with the highest rating on this IMDb site.

                                <h3>1. Highest Rated Movies On IMDb</h3>
                                <img src="image1.jpg" class="content-image" alt="Highest Rated Movies On IMDb" title="Highest Rated Movies On IMDb">
                                <p>The Shawshank Redemption is ranked first with a rating of 9.3 from the ratings given by 2.5 million users on the IMDb site. IMDb is the largest film database site in the world. On this site, there is a rating feature that users can use to rate a film.
                                </p>
    
                                <p>This film was followed by The Godfather with a rating of 9.2 from 1.7 million users on the IMDb site. From the data obtained from the site, The Shawshank Redemption has been in position for quite a long time.</p>
    
                                <h3>2. A Film With A Prison Setting, But Rich In Morals And Inspiration</h3>
                                <img src="image2.jpg" class="content-image" alt="A Film With A Prison Setting, But Rich In Morals And Inspiration" title="A Film With A Prison Setting, But Rich In Morals And Inspiration">
                                <p>Even though most of the setting in this film is a prison, this film actually succeeds in giving the audience many moral and inspiring stories, which we would not even expect. For example, in the middle of the film, Red says that <q>hope</q> is a dangerous thing in prison, but Andy manages to prove that hope is not something wrong, it is actually something <q>good</q> from the human being himself and will never die. <q>Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies</q>.
                                </p>
    
                                <p>This film also gives us a little insight, that people who are in prison are not necessarily better than others outside prison, in this case such as Officer Byron Hadley and Prison Head Samuel Norton, who apparently have committed massive money laundering. 
                                </p>
    
                                <h3>3. Adaptation Of A novel, And Has A Different Title From The Novel</h3>
                                <img src="image3.jpg" class="content-image" alt="Adaptation Of A novel, And Has A Different Title From The Novel" title="Adaptation Of A novel, And Has A Different Title From The Novel">
                                <p>This film is an adaptation of Stephen King's novel Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. His story is contained in a collection of novels with the title Different Seasons. King sold the copyright for the novel at a very low price to Frank Darabont, who was his best friend.
                                </p>
    
                                <p>Frank Darabont wrote the script for this film in approximately eight weeks. Before taking the script to Castle Rock Entertainment, he decided to remove Rita Hayworth from the title.
                                </p>
    
                                <p>This is reasonable so that the public is not mistaken that this film is the story of a woman named Rita Hayworth.
                                </p>
                            
                                <h3>4. A Film With A Plot Twist That Makes The Audience Gape</h3>
                                <img src="image4.jpg" class="content-image" alt="A Film With A Plot Twist That Makes The Audience Gape" title="A Film With A Plot Twist That Makes The Audience Gape">
                                <p>Since the beginning of this film, we will be taken to a situation where Andy Dufresne, who is a banker, is accused of having killed his wife and her lover. We are also confused whether it is true that Andy had committed the murder or not.
                                </p>
    
                                <p>After Andy was taken to Shawshank prison which is one of the strictest prisons, Andy was forced to serve his life sentence there. Andy, who is an <em>introvert</em>, makes it difficult for him to socialize with people in prison, until a month later Andy begins his conversation with Ellis 'Red' Boyd Redding
                                </p>
    
                                <p>The film runs with Andy and Red who live their daily lives in prison, until at the end of the film, there is a plot twist that even I would not have thought would happen like this (no spoiler).</p>
    
                                <h3>5. Released Under Different Titles In Several Countries</h3>
                                <img src="image5.jpg" class="content-image" alt="Released Under Different Titles In Several Countries" title="Released Under Different Titles In Several Countries">
                                <p>The Shawshank Redemption film has been released in various countries, and has many different titles in each country. This makes many people think that this is an action film.
                                </p>
                                    
                                <p>In Denmark it has the title "En Verden Udenfor" which means "A World Outside", then in Israel it is called "Homot Shel Tivka", meaning "Walls of Hope", and in Mexico it is called "Sueños de Fuga" which means "Dreams of escape".
                                </p>
